# Python Challenge Solutions
A repository of solutions to some PythonChallenge.com challenges that I solved.

All solutions here are in public domain, so feel free to do whatever you want with them.

Note that I strive for quick and short solutions rather then fast ones, and I always print the result URL,
sometimes without explaining in detail how I got there. Still, the solutions are fairly simple
and you shouldn't have any trouble understanding them :-P.
